🐱💡 Cat in a Dark — Project Summary

Overview:
“Cat in a Dark” is a creative and interactive mini web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where a cat's appearance changes based on a virtual light switch. It visually represents how a cat appears with glowing eyes in the dark when the lights are off, and looks normal in the light when turned on.

🔧 Technologies Used:
HTML (project1.html): Provides the page structure, including the cat image, light bulb image, and control buttons.
CSS (style.css): Adds styling to the background, buttons, layout, and images for a clean, simple look.
JavaScript (project1.js): Adds interactivity to the project by handling the switching logic (on/off).

⚙️ Features:
Switchable Mood (Light/Dark):
"On" mode: Shows a light bulb and a cat in the light.
"Off" mode: Switches to a dark bulb and a version of the cat with glowing eyes.

Button Feedback:
Color changes on the buttons reflect which state is currently active.

User Interface:
Centered layout with labeled buttons: On and Off.
Text feedback updates with "Switched ON" or "Switched OFF".

💡 How It Works:
User clicks the "On" or "Off" button.
JavaScript updates:
The image of the light bulb.
The image of the cat (normal or glowing eyes).
The button styles and the text label to show the current mode.

🎯 Learning Outcomes:
Understanding DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
How to change images dynamically using src attribute.
Applying CSS styling for interactive elements like buttons and backgrounds.
Creating simple interactive UI logic with conditional behaviors.
